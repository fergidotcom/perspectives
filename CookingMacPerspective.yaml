  Completed comprehensive v5.1.1 release combining UI/UX enhancements with major recipe data quality overhaul.

  Phase 1 (UI/UX): Fixed header/navigation clipping issues, compressed header spacing, reduced recipe card sizes for more compact mobile-first layout.

  Phase 2 (Data Quality): Created AI-powered enhancement script that processed all 96 recipes, adding units to ingredient quantities, integrating quantities into instruction steps, categorizing ingredients, removing extraneous content, and validating recipe quality. Removed 4 invalid recipes (96 → 92).

  All changes deployed to Linode production server successfully.
