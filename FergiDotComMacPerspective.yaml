    - "Reference Refinement has 7 Netlify Functions to convert"
    - "Functions: health, llm-chat, llm-rank, search-google, dropbox-oauth, resolve-urls, proxy-fetch"
    - "Follow Cooking migration pattern (Express.js server)"
    - "Deploy to Linode at refs.fergi.com or similar"

refs_migration_notes: |
  Reference Refinement uses:
  - 7 TypeScript Netlify Functions
  - Dropbox OAuth with PKCE (same as Cooking)
  - Anthropic Claude API (same as Cooking)
  - Google Custom Search API (unique to Refs)

  Migration pattern from Cooking applies:
  1. Create Express server consolidating all functions
  2. Create systemd service file
  3. Create nginx reverse proxy config
  4. Create deployment script
  5. Test locally, deploy, verify
