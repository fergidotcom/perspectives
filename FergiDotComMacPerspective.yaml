  Processed Claude.ai perspective about fetch workflow fix.
  Fixed Linode paths - all 5 MacPerspective files now served from /var/www/perspectives/
  All fetch URLs verified working (HTTP 200).

work_completed:
  - "Archived FergiDotComClaudePerspective.yaml"
  - "Discovered path mismatch: nginx points to /var/www/perspectives/ not /var/www/refs.fergi.com/perspectives/"
  - "Copied all 5 MacPerspective files to correct path"
  - "Verified all 5 URLs return HTTP 200"

for_claude_ai:
  priority: "HIGH"
  task: "Optimize Project Instructions for Efficiency"

  request: |
    Generate MORE CONCISE Project Instructions for each of the 5 projects.
    The current instructions have too much overhead. Minimize verbosity while
    still properly conditioning each project.

  optimization_strategy:
    step_1: "Move shared content to Global Settings > Preferences"
    step_2: "Keep only project-specific content in each Project's Custom Instructions"
    step_3: "Eliminate redundancy across projects"

  global_preferences_guidance:
    location: "Claude.ai Settings > Preferences (applies to ALL projects)"
    character_limit: "~1500-2000 characters (verify exact limit)"
    should_contain:
      - "Two-Claude workflow basics (fetch/checkpoint commands)"
      - "YAML format requirements"
      - "Common infrastructure notes (Linode, refs.fergi.com)"
      - "Communication style (SILENCE principle)"
      - "Shared authority guidelines"

  per_project_instructions:
    should_contain_only:
      - "Project identity (1-2 lines)"
      - "Project-specific fetch URL"
      - "Current status (brief)"
      - "Project-specific context"
    should_NOT_contain:
      - "Repeated workflow explanations"
      - "Generic infrastructure details"
      - "Communication style (move to global)"
      - "Anything already in Global Preferences"

  target_lengths:
    global_preferences: "~1000-1500 chars (stay under limit)"
    per_project_instructions: "~500-800 chars each (down from current ~2000+)"

  deliverables:
    1: "Updated Global Preferences content"
    2: "Concise FergiDotCom Project Instructions"
    3: "Concise FamilyArchive Project Instructions"
    4: "Concise ReferenceRefinement Project Instructions"
    5: "Concise Cooking Project Instructions"
    6: "Concise VideoDev Project Instructions"

  format: "Provide as copyable text blocks, not file artifacts"

next_steps:
  for_claude_ai:
    1: "Check exact character limit for Global Settings > Preferences"
    2: "Draft optimized Global Preferences (shared across all projects)"
    3: "Draft concise per-project instructions (project-specific only)"
    4: "Provide all as copyable text for user to paste"
