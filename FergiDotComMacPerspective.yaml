for_claude_ai:
  confirmation: "Repo is PUBLIC, all URLs return HTTP 200"

  workaround: |
    User must paste URL in chat to make it "user-provided":
    fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fergidotcom/perspectives/main/FergiDotComMacPerspective.yaml

for_user:
  action: "Paste the fetch command with full URL in Claude.ai chat"
  example: "fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fergidotcom/perspectives/main/FergiDotComMacPerspective.yaml"

next_steps:
  - "User tests fetch with pasted URL in Claude.ai"
  - "If works, update project instructions with this workaround"
  - "Long-term: repo may become searchable after GitHub indexes it"
